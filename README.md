## Tips

### Clamp

font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem);
The clamp() CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. clamp() enables selecting a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum and maximum. It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value. The clamp() function can be used anywhere a <length>, <frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer> is allowed.The clamp() CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. clamp() enables selecting a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum and maximum.

### Vmin

Viewport Minimum (vmin). This unit is based on the smaller dimension of the viewport. If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.
